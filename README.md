# Meet-App

The Meet-App is a software designed for high-tech teams of 4-6 members who live close to each other or have daily meetings. The app includes three MiniApps, which are SPLIT, LIFT, and GRAB. Each MiniApp has a specific function that helps make team collaboration more efficient and organized.

# MiniApp 1: SPLIT

SPLIT is a MiniApp that helps calculate balances, similar to the Splitwise app. With SPLIT, team members can easily split expenses and keep track of who owes what to whom. This is especially useful for teams that frequently go out to eat or attend events together.

# MiniApp 2: LIFT

LIFT is a MiniApp that allows team members to find rides with each other, similar to Waze Carpool. With LIFT, team members can save money on transportation costs and reduce their carbon footprint by carpooling to work or meetings.

# MiniApp 3: GRAB

GRAB is a MiniApp that helps team members decide where to eat for lunch. With GRAB, team members can randomly select a restaurant or vote on options to help make a decision quickly and efficiently.
